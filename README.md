# the-perfect-existence
We will program a better life for ourselves. We are working on a matrix.

Intro:
I am code-named Professor Kool and I am bored of the universe and so I would like to explore alternative options. I want to develop the Matrix [0]

These ideas are a starting point in simulating a new universe.

This needs a lot of work so we all need to put our hands together and pray for this.

My crednentials:
I have access to some private information (that is only communicated on abstract channels) and I have seen these alternative options. I have hacked into my own mind (using mind techniques and mind-benders) and developed techniques that allow humankind (and all beings, equally importantly) to access alternative source of information. (like lightspeed simulations using the brain).

[1] Matrix - 1999 film about living in a different reality.

If anyone is intersted, please take this knowledge and creat a beautiful world. One day, we will all live there and our bodies in this world can be put to better use.

Disclaimer:
Despite the metaphor, I believe there is a coherent and achievable goal here. We can ascend our thoughts to gian the ability to share and swap mind data. Please make your ideas public about this idea if you think this is worth pursuing.

Yours sincerely,
Code-named: Professor Cool

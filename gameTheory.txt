Framework - interactions of modules

Human creativity is procedural generation tuned by an uncountable number of variables. Humans are alleatoric, that means we follow patterns. We are, at least theoretically, predictable. A human is an easys

Everybody is working separately and there are millions of game workers repeating work and doing it separately. How can we design a framework

User interface is key.
We need to work out a way that converts one the artists assets into 

Each element of the game should be a standalone module.
	Every element has private and public members, like C++

Cascading Overrides Universe - physics -	Heirarchical levels that can overrride anything in previous levels. Anything at any step can be broken down and shared.

Fundamentally, Global settings can be overruled on a per-asset basis.

Interfaces And Interactions
	Collision

rather than XYZ, use f,r,u

Heirarchy
	Quarks / Quanta
	Atoms
		Molecules
	
Only allow parent to child communication + interact apart from global fundamental operations
What happens to shared assets

Why Unreal is bad: Keep Fixed assets separate from temporary assets  , Unreal Engine 4 seems to me really bad when it comes to organising assets. It used a hybrid folder /type based structure Unreal has a lot of editing windows. It would be good if it could all be done through the same window, with all those features.

Put metadata on everything

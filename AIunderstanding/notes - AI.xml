Tried to reduce a binary system 
Perhaps could run well on an analogue computer or would be cool anyway

Heirarchy allows a new phrase to inherit its parent's tags and will be very important for learning. Make a heirarchy of verbs and objects and emotions.

Heirarchy is just the tags and a noun can be linked to other through the "similar"

Convert emotion into tags.
A tag is anything, words, emotions and they are linked to one another.

If a sentence starts with a verb, it is an order for someone


Multithreading for more thoughts.

How does it act?
Give it goals. For example, maximise happiness. Maximised happiness 

Lydon, the issue is that you don't pick a verb and noun separately. No, but the AI can. 


Note to Lydon:
Instinctual links:
The are pre-programmed consequential links

The AI can be taught

Time is in terms of lifeterm. Using a float value of 1 being the person's life expectancy

AI decides what it could do and then assesses the environment cost.

Define emotions in terms of what you would do if you felt that way. Based on emotion what noun has strongest emotions in head.
Each of these are based on a scale stretched

Subtracting from an emotion is not the same as multiplying to get the inverse.
Subtracting is when something takes the edge of a good thing, for example. The inverse is when something directly involves that thing and is multiploed

Emotion is based upon its net emotional effect on the arguments rather than a single effect. More control this way
	forEach argument,
		does the noun have any tags that affect the meaning of this. e.g. edible for eat, This is a crossover between actions and objects but it is required
		If not, let emotionCluster[argument] = have an emotion cluster that affects the object;
		argument.processEmotion(emotionCluster); //This can treat inanimate objects as alive. Maybe that is a good thing.
		Combine the action cluster with the object cluster to generate half of the emotional impact on the observer AI
	Then the AI emotion is based on the interaction between emotions (those belonging to the action and the object) 
	//How do emotions interact?
	
	Rather than tags, use adjectives/descriptors, also instead of the animate/inanimate thing
	
Ongoing: Design scenarios that demonstrate cause and effect and use all of the verbs
Remember the context in which nouns are used
Make the preposition thing better - find their proper name - arguments
	
	this memory map doesnt work very well because hearing a friend is different from hearing an enemy. It works but it doesnt take into account context. It could probably infer context from each of the

Language is the most descriptive communication method. Not necessarily. Photos exchange

I've written thos somehwere else but the edible. Tags shold 
	
Have every function callable by the bot in whatever order it chooses. Complex shit. Each function has inputs and output that affect which other functions connect to them. I think this would be not produce useful results in the time I am willing to invest.
Thinking is not a single function but one never-ending, ever-changing process

<Things to perhaps consider>
	When an event happens, trace the path what is likely to happen
		Trace a logical path and insert self into that path to check if things work.
		
From the network of actions and their paths, Rank each:
	Their strength/likelihood
		This Strength รท Sum of all the strengths
	Their distance from the root event
		the inverse used as a multipier 1/n
	The effect of the next verbs
		These are added to the sum
	This branching introduces exponential time but each set of calculations is relatively small. Calculations do not have to occur every tick and could be staggered across AIs in the world to limit any CPU impact. Carrying out actions is performed on a different system.
		Tags can reduce this in very specific situations perhaps they amplify it
	AIs perhaps have a threshold above which I path is automatically selected.
	The AI needs to consider its actions within the path somehow
	
Each AI could store a snapshot of other AIs in it's knowledge to better make decisions - a naive implementation of saving that date would require squaring the amount of data. Could just store likes?
